# ZYNC
*Zync* is for rsync what fstab is for mounting. Simply define all files and
directories that you want to sync between two computers in a config file and call
*zync* to either push or pull theses files. The point of this script is that
it makes it easier to switch computers i.e. when doing home office. The zync.conf
ensures that all files of all different hosts can be organized in one place.
